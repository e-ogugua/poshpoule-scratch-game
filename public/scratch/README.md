# Scratch Game Integration

## How to add your Scratch game:

1. Export your Scratch project as HTML (File > Save to your computer > Save as HTML)
2. Rename the exported file to `poshpoule-farm-game.html`
3. Place it in this `/public/scratch/` directory
4. The game will automatically load in the web app

## Alternative: Direct .sb3 file
You can also place your .sb3 file here and use the Scratch player to embed it.
